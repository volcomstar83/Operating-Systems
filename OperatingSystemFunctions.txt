One of the functions of an operating system is to manage the available memory. With a combination of physical RAM and virtual memory, via flash drive or hard drive, the operation system must designate which applications can be handled by the physical memory first, then utitlize the virtual memory as a backup, or overflow. Utilizing the virtual memory, otherwise known as paging, too much can result in low performance and noticeable lag.
