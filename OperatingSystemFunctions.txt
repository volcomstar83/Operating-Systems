One of the functions of an operating system is to manage the available memory. With a combination of physical RAM and virtual memory, via flash drive or hard drive, the operation system must designate which applications can be handled by the physical memory first, then utitlize the virtual memory as a backup, or overflow. Utilizing the virtual memory, otherwise known as paging, too much can result in low performance and noticeable lag.
Another function of the operating system is to manage the programs being utilized. There are two types of operating systems when it comes to managing programs: single task operating system that can only manage one task at a time, or multitasking operating systems that can manage many programs at one time. By utilizing the memory as mentioned before, the multitasking operating system can move and shift programs in and around the physical memory and virtual memory as necessary.
